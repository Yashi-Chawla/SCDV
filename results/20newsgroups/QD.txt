Coming from an idiot/crook Armenian, I'd take that as a compliment.
Your criminal grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted
to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured 
petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of 
their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their 
mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. 
And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other 
nation had ever known in history.

"They [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian 
 invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and
 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least
 a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population."

I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack
of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,
I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end
to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they
are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why
he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot
fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of
fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final
regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.
 My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern
one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know
of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20
buit have no idea if they will work)
 
2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a
jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know
of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1
 
all help and advice appriciated.

GM has always screwed the rest of the divisions in favor of the
Corvette. The current platform is no exception. The "detuned" Camaro and
Firebird is a load of crap to keep people from realizing that they can
buy one of these instead of a Corvette and save about $10,000.

I like the idea of an Impala SS, but if they really wanted to impress
me, they would throw in a big phat 454. Imagine the cops in their Taurus
police package 3.0 and 3.8 litres as they stare at your taillights...

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.
 My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern
one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know
of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20
buit have no idea if they will work)
 
2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a
jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know
of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1
 
all help and advice appriciated.

If you won't believe anything the government says, and the press
is not reliable according to the same logic, then what do you base
your statements on?  Wild speculation laced with a healthy dose

I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack
of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,
I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end
to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they
are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why
he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot
fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of
fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final
regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack

are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why
he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot

Help: I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume 4,
Xt Intrisics Programming Manual, chapter 3. popup
dialog boxes and so on.

In example 3.5, page 76 : "Creating a pop-up dialog box"

The application creates window with a button "Quit" and "Press me".
The button "Press me" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of
this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), 
it is *much* slower.

Has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get
this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response
time from 2nd time onwards ?
Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time
they popup in reasonable fast response time ?

Thankyou - Shirley

I accidently erased the command in my povray.def that made the image a targas

having to re-trace them? By fix I mean, turn them into targas. Thanks in

If you won't believe anything the government says, and the press

your statements on?  Wild speculation laced with a healthy dose

Subject: Re: Mary's assumption
Organization: University of Nebraska--Lincoln
Lines: 31

I hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before, but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that "the assumption of Mary" would be better phrased "our
assumptions _about_ Mary."  In all the time I've been reading about
Mary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scriptural
foundation.  

I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents
as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to God's working, beyond doubt.  But the almalga-
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human
desire.  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knew
temptation, albeit without submitting to it.

I also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some-
how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or-
dinary human being.  

I won't start yelling about how people are "worshipping" Mary, etc.,
since folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think we
lose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a 
resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources aren't driving directly into each other. 

Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing
high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,
etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing
line-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.

input 1 --/\/\/\/ -------------+--- output
                               |
input 2 --/\/\/\/\-------------+

There are a lot of mushrooms and toadstools out on the lawn at the

If the hayfever gets any worse, maybe I will cook those toadstools...

Subject: Re: Mary's assumption
Organization: University of Nebraska--Lincoln
Lines: 31

I hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before, but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that "the assumption of Mary" would be better phrased "our
assumptions _about_ Mary."  In all the time I've been reading about
Mary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scriptural
foundation.  

I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents
as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to God's working, beyond doubt.  But the almalga-
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human
desire.  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knew
temptation, albeit without submitting to it.

I also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some-
how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or-
dinary human being.  

I won't start yelling about how people are "worshipping" Mary, etc.,
since folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think we
lose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.
